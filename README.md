## 🧠 Game Play Tips

- Use sprinting (`Shift + W`) for speed, or to avoid enemies, patrols, or to cover distances quickly.
- Controlling recoil is momumentally important, and burst firing will push the recoil down which gives you greater accuracy.
- Be in awareness of your surroundings. Enemies will flank you, and take opportunities to ambush you.
- Jumping and moving sideways either with `A` or `D` allows you to dodge bullets from enemies.
